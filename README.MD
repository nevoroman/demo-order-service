## Unfinished version of an Order Service

The current version is unfinished and mostly aims to provide suitable points for discussion on a call and a backbone for future improvements. That's the main points the current version is missing:

- Suitable test coverage: the test infrastructure is built, but proper coverage would take another 3-4 hours
- Complete courier assignment flow and some of the status change functionality
- A lot of error handling scenarios
- Logging, documentation, and Docker: simply had no time to implement it

The priority was put into setting up an infrastructure code: security, Kafka, repositories and so on. The focus was made on the code which would provide some good topics for discussion in an interview.
